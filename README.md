# Computer Science II – Search Algorithms and Graphs Simulator

## 📌 Overview

This project is an academic simulation developed for the **Computer Science II** course.  
It implements and demonstrates core concepts related to:

- Internal search algorithms
- External search methods
- Graph data structures
- Graph traversal algorithms

The objective of this project is to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Implementation of internal search techniques (e.g., sequential and tree-based searches).
- Simulation of external searching concepts.
- Graph representations (adjacency list / matrix depending on implementation).
- Graph traversal algorithms (such as DFS and BFS).
- Clear structure for educational purposes.

## 🐍 Python Version

This project is built and tested using:
**Python 3.11.9**

Make sure you are using this version (or a fully compatible one) to avoid unexpected issues.
