"""This module launches the FastAPI application and embeds it inside
a native desktop window using pywebview.

It starts the FastAPI server in a background thread, waits until the
server is available, and then creates a window that loads the web
interface. This allows the application to run as a standalone desktop
program without requiring a browser.
